							<h2>Spring 2017</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><b>IR 599 Science, Politics and Climate Change:</b> This course focuses on the interplay between science, technology and policy-making from the perspective of science and technology studies (STS), which is an interdisciplinary field that examines the societal context in which science is conducted and the interplay between science and politics in identifying and addressing policy issues. Specifically, the course applies a STS perspective to climate change science and policy. It introduces students to STS and to central scientific and political debates that shape climate change policy. The goal is to understand the larger picture of intertwining relationships between scientific, technical and political systems that shape policy with a focus on climate change mitigation and adaptation. The course, which is based on a combination of short lectures and extensive class discussion, begins with an introduction to STS and often very complex relationships between science, technology and policy-making. In parallel, the course explores the history of climate change science up to present days understanding of the climate system and climate change. Next, the course applies a multilevel governance perspective as it examines major climate change policy developments across global, regional, national and local levels. Finally, the course looks at the roles of different non-state actors and strategies for communicating climate change science and policy. </li>
