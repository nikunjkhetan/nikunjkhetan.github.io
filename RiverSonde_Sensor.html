							<p>Humans have relied on fresh and saltwater rivers for transportation, clean drinking water, irrigation, and food since the earliest recorded history. Compared to oceans and other large bodies of water, however, rivers are significantly understudied, especially with respect to the effects of climate change. In an effort to close this research gap, we have set out to develop the RiverSonde, a low profile underwater sensor suite that enables inexpensive remote collection of water quality data from rivers and streams. We’ve designed RiverSonde to be hydroelectrically powered by a river's natural current, making it deployable in low sunlight areas. We've also made it mesh networking ready, meaning that a multiple sonde network can be deployed to take remote measurements even in areas without cellular coverage. By implementing sensors and electronics that are typically only found in 3000 dollar plus laboratory probes while keeping our unit cost under 500 dollars, we hope to give budget constrained research and regulatory agencies a powerful new tool.</p>
							<p>One of the fundamental challenges is the detection and measurement of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). Phytoplankton, cyanobacteria and algae have hundreds or thousands of different taxonomical categories and sub-categories and produce a diverse array of environmental and health hazards. Many potential species and their effects are either poorly understood or remain undiscovered. IOC-UNESCO has an ongoing effort to document and track the taxonomic information of identified species and provides a publicly accessible list indicating the potential scope of a detection challenge. Additionally, many bacteria or algae are functional parts of an ecosystem and are not necessarily harmful to ecosystem stability or human health and industry. Robustly making these distinctions in various geographical locations comprises the overarching challenge in HAB detection.</p>
							<p>Modularity, affordability, accessibility, and coverage are key restrictions in approaching this problem. In addition to those design limitations, our clients the Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR) and the Charles River Watershed Association have shown interest in collecting data on the following</p>

							<h2>Chlorophyll Sensor</h2>  
							<p>Our approach to designing the core sensor suite in RiverSonde is split into three parts. COTS sensors like thermocouples, humidity gauges (for leak detection inside the shell), pressure transducers and more are easily integrated and comprise the first part. Second, taking chlorophyll-a measurements can yield broad and potentially indicative information about algal blooms and biomass concentrations at given points in the river. Leeuw et. al. demonstrated a cheap DIY chlorophyll-a sensor which excites chlorophyll with a blue LED and measures the intensity of the emitted light to calculate a chlorophyll concentration near the surface of the sensor. We integrated this approach into the hull of our platform. Finally, for the third portion, we considered the remaining metrics the DCR and CRWA asked us to attempt to measure.</p>
							<h2>DIY Cytometer</h2>
							<p>With one measurement out of chlorophyll and phycocyanin successful, the next consideration was if it was possible to directly evaluate either HAB toxins or bacterial species. Since toxins were smaller and more chemically challenging to evaluate given our constraints, we focused on considering approaches to bacterial or algal species. A key capability of our approach needed to be a capacity to take in situ measurements of our target molecules. Flow cytometry is one approach that has been implemented on a DIY scale that could fit our needs and take in situ measurements.</p>
							<p>Benchtop approaches to flow cytometry typically cost several thousand dollars and are not useful for taking remote in situ measurements and process samples at a slow rate. A team at UCLA demonstrated a 2500 dollar DIY cytometer that had a relatively high throughput (100 mL/hr). While that’s an order of magnitude cheaper than traditional cytometers, it was still above our budget. Also, the cytometer relied on computer vision on captured images to identify target organisms. Traditional computer vision is computationally expensive and consumes large amounts of power, well beyond our platform's rated capacity.</p>
							<p>In order to address the computation and power consumption issues, we turned to a subsampling technique called single pixel imaging. Subsampling techniques work by taking a fraction of a potentially available dataset and either reconstructing the remaining dataset from the small sample or acting on the fractional sample to perform a task. Single pixel imaging is a technique where an image is captured by a single pixel over a (relatively) long period of exposure. With a single pixel camera, a small fraction of the relevant pixels can be captured until enough information is available to identify the target organisms in the field of view. This drastically cuts the amount of information needed to be processed, bringing the processing and power requirements in line with what could be supported by RiverSonde. We currently are building and testing a benchtop version of this hybrid flow cytometer/single pixel camera to measure the microcystin and potentially E. Coli requested by our clients. Additionally, such a setup is also modular enough to be adapted to other organisms based on the ecosystem specifics.</p>
